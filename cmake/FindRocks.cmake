# - Try to find libacu include dirs and libraries
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#     find_package(Rocks)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  RDB_ROOT_DIR              Set this variable to the root installation of
#                            librocksdb if the module has problems finding the
#                            proper installation path.
#
# Variables defined by this module:
#
#  RDB_FOUND            System has librocksdb, include and lib dirs found
#  RDB_INCLUDE_DIR      The librocksdb include directories.
#  RDB_LIBRARY          The librocksdb library.
